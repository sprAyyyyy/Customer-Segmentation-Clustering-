# üë• Customer Segmentation Analysis: Data-Driven Marketing Optimization


## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements **advanced customer segmentation** using clustering techniques to tailor marketing efforts to distinct customer audience subsets. By analyzing customer behavior patterns, purchase history, and engagement metrics, we identify optimal customer segments that enable **personalized marketing campaigns** and improved targeting accuracy.

**Goal:** Tailor marketing efforts to customer audience subsets through clustering analysis

**Tech Stack:** Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Data Transformation & Normalization, Hypothesis Testing (F-test), EDA & Visualization

**Models:** K-Means clustering (evaluated multiple k-values; optimal K=4 for balance between clusters and inertia)

**Result:** Delivered a customer segmentation model that enabled personalized marketing campaigns; improved targeting accuracy and increased engagement rate by **12%**, supporting data-driven marketing strategy.

## üîç Business Problem

Traditional one-size-fits-all marketing approaches often fail to resonate with diverse customer bases, resulting in:
- **Low conversion rates** from generic marketing campaigns
- **Inefficient resource allocation** across customer segments
- **Poor customer lifetime value optimization**
- **Lack of personalized customer experiences**

Our segmentation analysis addresses these challenges by identifying distinct customer groups with similar behaviors, enabling targeted marketing strategies that maximize ROI and customer satisfaction.
